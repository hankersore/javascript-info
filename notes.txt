Notes for JS

A variable is a “named storage” for data

Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using let. This still works now if we don’t put use strict in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.

NaN is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on NaN returns NaN

Null is just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
